** TODO **

** Write installation script
**       Makefile
**       manpage
** Proper INSTALL documentation
************************************

1. Compile the file curlfish.c and install the resulting  in a directory of your choice (/usr/local/bin is perfectly fine, but it is usually on a separate filesystem and thus unavailable when only / is mounted)

2. Create symbolic links that point from curlfish to the full pathname of a script interpreter appended with ^M...
e.g. 

$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/curlfish /bin/bash^M

/bin/ksh^M -> /bin/curlfish
/usr/bin/tcsh -> /bin/curlfish
/usr/local/bin/python^M -> /bin/curlfish
 
3. Compile the manpage and install into the appropriate manual section (probably /usr/local/share/man/man1 )

4. ???

5. Profit!
